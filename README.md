# Netflix-clone

In this project, I have created a clone of Netflix using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To build a complex movie section, I have used JavaScript DOM and Fetch API, which allows users to play the trailer of a movie or show by just hovering over it.

For getting the movie-related data, I have integrated the Tmdb API, which has helped to fetch all the necessary information about movies. In addition, to fetch the trailer of a movie, I have used Google's YouTube data API, which has allowed me to retrieve the trailer of the selected movie.

To make the website look similar to the Netflix website, I have used CSS without any framework, which has resulted in a visually appealing and user-friendly website. The website provides users with a rich and seamless experience of browsing through movies and watching trailers of their favorite shows.

Overall, this project has been an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building a website that replicates the functionality of a popular streaming platform like Netflix.
